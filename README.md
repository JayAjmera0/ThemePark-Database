# Theme Park Database

## Introduction

The Theme Park Database is a comprehensive repository that provides deep insights into various facets of a theme park. It encompasses tables for rides, restaurants, shops, employees, customers, tickets, and transactions. By utilizing SQL queries to analyze data from these tables, we can extract valuable insights into the theme park's operations. These insights range from identifying popular rides to gauging revenue from different facilities, and even evaluating employee productivity. The Theme Park Database serves as a robust tool for enhancing theme park operations and visitor experiences.

## Overview

Our collaborative effort has culminated in the creation of a dynamic database for storing ride, restaurant, shop, employee, customer, ticket, and transaction data within a theme park environment. We meticulously identified key entities and their relationships, resulting in well-structured tables with appropriate attributes and constraints. Ensuring data integrity and security, we implemented primary and foreign keys alongside data validation rules.

The project boasts a comprehensive array of SQL queries tailored to assist park management in extracting insights pertinent to various operational aspects. These queries enable the analysis of customer behavior, ride popularity, employee performance, revenue generation, and more. Our team's collaborative dedication has produced a functional and well-designed database poised to cater to the needs of a theme park, facilitating data-driven decisions, optimizing operations, and enhancing visitor experiences.

## Motivation

Having observed inefficiencies in theme park management post various park visits, we were compelled to create this database. We aimed to leverage SQL's organizational prowess to simplify transaction and relationship management. Recognizing the inadequacies in existing management practices and resource limitations, we believe that our segmented database will streamline operations and provide insights to optimize management processes. Well-known parks like Universal Studios, Disneyland, and Imagica served as motivating examples.
